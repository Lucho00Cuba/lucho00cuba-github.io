# Prerequisites

Before we dive into Python, we need to make sure we have the necessary tools and libraries installed on our system. Here are the prerequisites you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to choose the latest version of Python 3.

# Installing Python

Before we dive into the code, let's first set up Python on your machine.

:::::tabs

::::tab{title="macOS (via Homebrew)"}

:::note{type=info}
On macOS, Python is usually pre-installed. To check if Python is installed, run:
:::

```bash
brew install python
```
::::

::::tab{title="Windows"}

Download the latest version of Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer. Make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

::::

::::tab{title="Linux"}
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```
::::

:::::

Once you have Python installed, you can use pip to install the necessary libraries and packages for Python. Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install, upgrade, and manage third-party libraries and packages.

To install pip, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade # This will install pip, the Python package installer, on your system.
```

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It is a good practice to use virtual environments to isolate dependencies for different projects. Here’s how to set it up:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

This ensures that the packages you install do not interfere with your global Python environment.

## Verifying the Installation

To verify that Python is installed correctly, run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

# Installing Packages with pip

Once your environment is set, you can use `pip` to install packages. For instance, to install `requests`, a popular HTTP library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

You can also install packages from a requirements file:

```bash
# ./requirements.txt
requests
```

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

# Basic Syntax: Variables, Print Statements, and Data Types

Python's syntax is known for being simple and easy to read, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Let’s explore some key components that form the foundation of Python’s syntax.

## Variables

In Python, you don't need to declare a variable type. Python automatically assigns the type based on the value you assign to the variable. This dynamic typing makes Python flexible and easy to use.

To assign a value to a variable, simply use the `=` operator:

```python
x = 10  # Integer
name = "John"  # String
is_true = True  # Boolean
```

Here are some examples of different data types in Python:

- *Integer*: Whole numbers, like `10` or `-5`.
- *String*: Text values enclosed in quotes, such as `"Hello"` or `'Python'`.
- *Boolean*: Values that are either `True` or `False`.

## Print Statements

Python provides the `print()` function to display output to the console. This is useful for debugging, outputting results, or just checking the values of variables.

To print a value or expression:

```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Prints the value of x
```

You can also print strings with variables:

```python
name = "John"
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
print(greeting)
# or using f-strings for more readability:
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # f-strings are a Python 3.6+ feature
```

In the example above, the `f"Hello, {name}!"` is an example of an f-string, which allows embedding expressions inside string literals.

## Data Types

Python supports a variety of built-in data types, which are the core building blocks when it comes to storing and manipulating data. Here's a quick overview of the most common ones:

### **Numbers**

Includes integers (int) and floating-point numbers (float).

```python
integer_num = 42  # Integer
float_num = 3.14  # Floating point number
```

### **Strings**

Text data can be stored in either single or double quotes.

```python
sentence = "This is a string"
multiline_str = '''This is a 
multiline string'''
```

### **Booleans**

A boolean type has two possible values: `True` or `False`.

```python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False
```

### **Lists**

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. Lists can contain elements of different types.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")  # Adds 'orange' to the list
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

### **Dictionaries**

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. You can store information with a unique key, making it easier to retrieve associated data.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

### **Sets**

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
unique_numbers.add(5)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### **Tuples**

Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. They are similar to lists, but cannot be modified once created.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 10
```

## Comments in Python

Comments are an essential part of writing readable code. In Python, a single-line comment is preceded by the `#` symbol:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # This assigns 10 to x
```

For multi-line comments, Python doesn't have a specific syntax for block comments, but you can use multi-line strings (`'''` or `"""`) as a workaround:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring used for documentation
"""
```

# Error Handling and Debugging in Python

In programming, errors are inevitable. What’s important is knowing how to handle and debug them effectively. Python provides several ways to deal with errors and track down issues in your code.

## Common Types of Errors in Python

| Error Type | Source Code | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Syntax Errors | ```print("Hello, World!"  # Missing closing parenthesis``` | Occur when Python can't parse the code because of incorrect syntax |
| Runtime Errors | ```x = 10 / 0 # Division by zero``` | Occur when the code is syntactically correct, but an error happens during execution. |
| Logical Errors | `No code snippet needed` | These occur when the code runs without raising an error, but the output is incorrect due to a mistake in the logic. These can be harder to debug because they don't cause the program to crash. |

## Error Handling with `try` and `except`

Python allows you to catch and handle errors using `try` and `except` blocks. This lets you prevent the program from crashing and handle specific errors in a graceful way.

Here’s an example of handling a `ZeroDivisionError`:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
```

This will output: `You can't divide by zero!`, instead of crashing the program.

You can also handle multiple types of errors:

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number!")
```

## Using `else` and `finally`

The `else` block runs if no exceptions were raised, while the `finally` block runs no matter what (whether an exception was raised or not). This is useful for cleanup tasks like closing files or network connections.

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number!")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

## Debugging with `pdb`

Python has a built-in debugger called `pdb` (Python Debugger). It allows you to step through your code and examine its state at different points in the execution.

You can add `pdb` to your script like this:

```python
import pdb

x = 10
y = 0

pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint here

result = x / y  # This will raise an error
```

When the program reaches `pdb.set_trace()`, it will pause and give you an interactive prompt to inspect the values of variables, step through the code, or continue execution.

You can run your script with the Python debugger by using the following command:

```bash
python -m pdb myscript.py
```

In the interactive session, you can use commands like:

- `n` (next): Execute the next line of code.
- `s` (step): Step into functions.
- `c` (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
- `p` (print): Print the value of a variable (e.g., p x).

## Logging

For more advanced debugging and tracking errors over time, you can use Python's logging module. This is a powerful tool for logging errors, warnings, and other events in your program.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```

The `logging` module allows you to log different levels of messages (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) and configure where these messages are recorded (e.g., in a file or console).

# Your First Python Script

Now that Python is installed, let’s write a simple Python script.

Create a file called `hello.py` with the following content:

```python
# hello.py
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Hello, World!")
    print(f"If you want to say hello to someone else, pass their name as an argument.")
    print("Usage: python hello.py <name>")
else:
    name = sys.argv[1]
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

The script imports the `sys` module, which provides access to the command line arguments passed to the script.

Save the file and run it:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Hello, World!
# or
Hello, John!
```
